Basic Concepts for All Simulations
--------------------------------------

This section presents concepts about PSim that you should understand before
creating and running simulations. Taking the time to examine these
concepts before reading about the simulation process, will make the simulation
procedures simple to understand and tutorial lessons straightforward to follow.

Simulation Grid 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every object in a PSim simulation interacts with a 3D grid, in
Cartesian coordinates. Future development will enable simulations on AMR
grids. 
Length scales in the simulation are scaled by the radius of gyration
of the first Polymer object in the input file.
