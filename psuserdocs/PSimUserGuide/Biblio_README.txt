Biblio_Using_PSim.rst was created with pandoc acting on the html publication page on the Tech-X site.

    Command: pandoc --from=html --to=rst Tech-X-PSim-Product-Publications.html -o  Tech-X-PSim-Product-Publications.rst
Then it was edited heavily. Probably dont need to re-generate rst page from scratch.
