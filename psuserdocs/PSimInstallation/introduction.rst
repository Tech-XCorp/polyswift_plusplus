Introduction
--------------------------------------

Welcome to the PSim, the self-consistent field theory code
for simulating mesoscale structure of complex block copolymer mixtures.
PSim consists of two major components:

    - PolySwift++ computational engine
    - PSimComposer graphical user interface

PSimComposer provides an interface that allows you to edit and
validate your simulation input files, run PolySwift++ simulations, and
visualize results using the VisIt-based Visualization pane
embedded within PSimComposer.  You can also edit
PolySwift++ input files in the text editor of your choice, perform
calculations with the easy-to-run, command-line-driven PolySwift++ executable, and
then run the visualization tool of your choice.

..
  PSim is supported on:
    -  64-bit Linux
    -  Macintosh OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)
    -  Macintosh OS X Lion (10.7)
    -  Macintosh OS X Snowleopard (10.6)
    -  Windows XP and above (32 and 64-bit)


A serial version of PolySwift++ is available for running on single
processor workstations. A parallel version of PolySwift++ is provided
for multi-core systems that support the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
